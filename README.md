# ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET - Toolkit

The ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET Toolkit contains controls and utilities you can use with [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](http://links.esri.com/dotnetsdk).

You can use the Toolkit in your projects by:
1. Building the source code available in this repo (see instructions below)
2. Installing the latest stable release from NuGet: [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit)   

## Features

- Compass - Shows a compass direction when the map is rotated. Auto-hides when the map points north up.
- Legend - Displays a legend for a single layer in your map (and optionally for its sub layers).
- ScaleLine - Displays current scale reference.
- ChallengeHandler - (WPF only) Displays a UI dialog to enter or select credentials to use when accessing secure ArcGIS resources, as well as helper classes for storing credentials in Windows' credentials cache. 
- SymbolDisplay - Renders a symbol in a control.
- TableOfContents (WPF)- Creates a tree-view of the entire map document. Optionally displays legend information for the layers as well. 

## Instructions for Building

1. Fork and then clone the repo or download the .zip file.
2. The Toolkit requires ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET. 
 * Confirm that your system meets the requirements for using ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET with:
   - [WPF](http://developers.arcgis.com/net/desktop/guide/system-requirements.htm)
   - [UWP](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/uwp/guide/system-requirements.htm)
   - [Xamarin.Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/android/guide/system-requirements.htm)
   - [Xamarin.iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/ios/guide/system-requirements.htm)
   - [Xamarin.Forms (Android, iOS, and UWP)](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/forms/guide/system-requirements.htm)
 * Note that the Toolkit references [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](http://esriurl.com/dotnetsdk) by Nuget package. The package is automatically downloaded when you build the solution for the first time.
3. Confirm that your system meets the requirements for compiling the Toolkit
    - Visual Studio 2017 Update 3+
    - .NET Core 2.0 SDK
    - Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android SDKs
4. Include or reference the Toolkit in your projects:
    - a. Include the appropriate platform Projects in your Solution.
     - WPF (src\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit\WPF\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.WPF.csproj)
     - UWP (\src\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit\UWP\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.UWP.csproj)
     - Xamarin.Android (\src\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit\Android\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.Android.csproj)
     - Xamarin.iOS (\src\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit\iOS\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.iOS.csproj)
     - Xamarin.Forms (\src\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit\XamarinForms\Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Toolkit.Xamarin.Forms.csproj)
    - b. Build the Toolkit and reference the NuGet package you built.
     - Building each Toolkit project automatically creates the NuGet package for each platform in the project Output folder.
     - Create a local nuget source and set it to the \Output\NuGet\Release folder.
     - Add the nuget package using the standard Nuget package manager dialog in Visual Studio.
     * It is also possible to create a nuget source pointing to the latest build (automatically updated after each pull-request gets merged): `https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/arcgis-toolkit-dotnet`
